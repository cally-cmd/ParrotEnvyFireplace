# ParrotEnvyFireplace

## Title

The title of our game is `A Home for Parrot`!

## Intent

Our intent for making this game is to further develop our abilities with Unity by creating a game that built on some of the aspects introduced in the first game while also adding some aesthetic choices to improve the gameplay experience. 

## Narrative

You play as a stray parrot that sees another parrot living in a house in this small town. The stray parrot is envious of the warmth that the other parrot gets to experience living inside this house, and so when the stray parrot goes to speak to the other parrot, the other parrot informs the stray one of a way to get its own warmth! It must collect the wood logs scattered through the town to create a small little fireplace in the center of the meadow, and then it can have a warm fire.

## Mechanics

To move the parrot in the game you can use either WASD or the arrow keys. In order to interact with the other parrot the player must have their mouse hover over it! To collect the wood logs the player need only navigate the parrot to them. 

## Aesthetics

**Insert aesthetics here**

## Joys and Struggles

There are few things more frustrating than writing correct code to implement a feature only to then not connect it to the correct game objects and variables inside of Unity. This happened a few times! The complement to this is when *everyting* is done correctly on the first try! A satisfaction like no other! Another joy was watching the visuals and sounds slowly come together; like our child is slowly growing up!

## Contributions

In this project I was responsible for the GameManager, Wood, Parrot, Bird, and FollowCam scripts. I also created most of the map, made the prefab for the sign and other parrots, and added to the wood prefabs. I made the trail and particle systems and found the image for the dialog box. Taryn made the wood prefab, found the tilemap, audio, parrot sprite, while setting them up in the scene where they belonged. Taryn also created the idea for game and its narrative. Taryn got the canvas and dialog box, the FollowCam script, and the collision of fences and buildings to work properly.
